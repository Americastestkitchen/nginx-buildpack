## Creating a new build

When this buildpack deploys on Heroku, the binary file corresponding to the currently configured stack (bin/nginx-cedar-14) is used. Rebuilding this binary can be done using the `scripts/build_nginx.sh` script. The script must be executed on a server that resembles the heroku stack as closely as possible. The steps below were used to create the latest build.

### Change the build file
If you are interested in creating a new build, you will need to modify the `scripts/build_nginx.sh` file.
1) Create a branch
2) Make your changes
3) Create the new build (see below)
4) Validate your build works on www-dev or www-staging (see below)
5) Open a PR
6) Merge PR

### Create a VM
1) Heroku makes their Cedar builds available on docker. Checking the [Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/cedar/~/dockerfile/) for Cedar, note that it uses Ubuntu 14.04
2) Go to the [Download Page for Ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)
3) Download the [64-bit PC (AMD64) server install image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.5-server-amd64.iso) `.iso` file.
4) Using Virtual Machine, create a new Ubuntu Linux VM, allocating at least 10GB of space to a virtual HDD
5) Start the Virtual Machine - you will be asked to select a 'CD' - choose the `.iso` file you downloaded in step 3.
6) Complete the installation process for Ubuntu Server. This will take a while.

### Configure the VM
After you complete the install process, you will have a basic server. You will need to install the dependencies required for building nginx.

Ubuntu uses `apt-get` for most software installations. The following commands (and probably a few more that I forgot to document...sorry!) were required to successfully build nginx. These commands assume you are running as `root`,

# *NOTE*: All of these packages correlate to what is specified in the build script. If you are rebuilding because you are updating nginx to a newer version or compiling for a new version of Ubuntu, YMMV. If you change the versions of the software check the README for the various nginx modules. There are some good hints in there regarding compatibility for different scenarios.

```bash
$ apt-get install git
$ apt-get install build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
$ apt-get install openssl libssl-dev libssl0.9.8 ca-certificates
$ apt-get install lua5.1 liblua5.1.0 liblua5.1.0-dev
$ ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so /usr/lib/liblua.so
$ apt-get install libgeoip-dev
$ apt-get install make
```

### Build nginx
```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir src
$ cd src
$ git clone https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/nginx-buildpack.git
$ cd nginx-buildpack
< make desired changes to scripts/build_nginx>
$ scripts/build_nginx.sh
```
The above command will create a new binary file at `/tmp/nginx/sbin/nginx`. Copy this file to your `bin` directory in your `nginx-buildback` directory.

```bash
$ cp /tmp/nginx/sbin/nginx ~/src/nginx-buildpack/bin/nginx-cedar-14
```

*NOTE* If you are changing heroku stacks, you will need to name the file based on the name of the heroku stack.

### Test Your New nginx
1) In the Heroku dashboard, open `atk-kraken-dev`
2) In the Settings tab, delete the current buildpack
3) Create a new buildpack, `https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/nginx-buildpack.git#<your-branch-name-here>`
4) In the Deploy tab, deploy `master` or your current working branch
5) Test your new build, monitoring the logs for errors

### Deploy your working branch to production
Make absolutely sure your new build works. `kraken` sits in front of *everything*. So, if you screw it up, the whole site will be affected.

1) In the Heroku dashboard, open `atk-kraken-production`
2) In the Settings tab, delete the buildpack
3) Create a new buildpack, `https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/nginx-buildpack.git#<your-branch-name-here>`
4) In the Deploy tab, deploy `master` (or your `kraken` release branch)
5) Monitor the logs like a hawk

After the dust has settled and you are confident nginx is stable, you can merge your working branch to master. Then, change `atk-kraken-dev` and `atk-kraken-production` buildpack back to `https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/nginx-buildpack.git`. The change will go into effect the next time you deploy `kraken`.
